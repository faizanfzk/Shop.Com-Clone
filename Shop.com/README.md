# Shop.com-fw15
A clone of the website shop.com by web15 cohort students from Masai School.

Our site features a Home Page, Men's Clothing section, Women's Clothing section and Girl's clothing section with appropriate products in each.
Our main aim was to ensure that the user has a good experience and hence we created simple but effective userflow for every section, such as having an account creation page, a login page and a cart page. Payment and address pages were created to ensure proper inputs for user data.


For Payment: Enter 123 as card number, 123 as CVV and 12/25 for expiry date.
For OTP: Enter 1234.
